# SourceHubIT_CustomerChurnPrediction
Machine learning project to predict customer churn using classification models.📊 Customer Churn Prediction
🔍 Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will leave a service (churn) based on behavioral data such as tenure, monthly charges, contract type, and payment method. It demonstrates key data science skills including:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results

🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

📁 Dataset
The dataset should be named customer_churn.csv and placed in the same directory as the notebook. It must contain columns like:
- tenure
- MonthlyCharges
- Contract
- PaymentMethod
- Churn
You can generate a sample dataset using the notebook if needed.

⚙️ How to Run
- Clone or download the project folder.
- Open the Jupyter Notebook.
- Ensure customer_churn.csv is in the same folder.
- Run the notebook cells in order:
- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and encodes categorical data.
- Model Training: Uses Random Forest to train on customer data.
- Evaluation: Prints accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve.

📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- ROC Curve with AUC
